# Manuscript outline

- About the deep review
 - Benefits of open reviews in general: clarify work with original authors, broader community opinion, post-publication peer review of individual papers, prune topics that don’t draw interest
 - Short intro to deep review, goals, timeline, number of words, references, etc.
- How we did it
 - (Do we want to discuss the build process, references, timestamps, etc? Or wait to see if space permits? Maybe some of that falls under "living document".)
 - Collaborative writing platform w/ tracking, drawbacks of traditional collaborative writing platforms in massively open setting
 - Review of each contribution + commenting
 - Separate setup for discussion of papers
 - Figure: flowchart showing version i of document, commits, pull request, reviews, commits, …, merge, version i + 1 of document (I think we'll need to illustrate the tracking and review system for readers who don't use version control systems)
- Dealing with authorship
 - Benefit - authorship and contributions precisely defined.
 - Challenge: how to make a traditional author list?
 - The Gitter System, equivalence classes as generalization of “co-first”
- Other considerations
 - Versioning/provenance of metadata (issues, pull requests, etc) (We can refer to or implement? strategies for backup up a GitHub repo https://help.github.com/articles/backing-up-a-repository/)
 - Publication system/journal of the future & how it relates
 - Other areas of open science and innovative ideas (or out of scope?)
 - Living document
 - Would a GitHub-based strategy be a barrier to entry for other groups that don’t already use git?
 - Conflict management, point to open source software strategies
